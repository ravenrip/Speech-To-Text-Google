This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity, but 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. 100 years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. 100 years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. 100 years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.

In a sense, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our Republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which ever American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note in so far as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds.

To dramatize. A shameful condition. Innocence, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When they architects of our republic. Broke the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence. They will signing a promise or not. To whichever an American wants to fall out. This north was a promise at all men. Yes, black men as well as white men. Would be guaranteed see on alienable rights of life liberty? And the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today. That america has defaulted on this promissory note in so far as her citizen's of color are concerned. Instead of honoring, this sacred obligation. America has given the negro people a bad check. I'll check which has come back. Mark, insufficient farm.

We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom, and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.

We refuse to believe that that i insufficient funds and the great faults of opportunity of this nation. So we've come to cast this check or check that will give us the pandemand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot. To remind a miracle of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time. To engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time. To make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time. The rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice now is the time The left our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rocker brotherhood. Now is the time. Make justice a reality for all of god's children.

This sweltering summit of the Negroes legitimate discontent will not pass until that is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.

The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. But that is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plain of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protests to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy, which has engulfed the Negro community, must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize their destiny is tied up in our destiny.

We cannot walk alone, and as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. They are those who asking the devotees of civil rights, when will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negroes basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating, For Whites Only. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote, and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.

When you can never be satisfied as long as we promises on speakerphone. Of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the harboring and the hotel.

Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that honor and suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you today, my friend, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, 'We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created.'

That's some of you have come here. Out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cell. Some of you have come from areas where you press quest for freedom. Left you batted by the storms of persecution. You stagger by the winds of police brutality. You happen, the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with a fans. That honor and suffering. Is redempted. Go back to mississippi. Go back to Alabama. Go back to south carolina, go back to Georgia. Go back to louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos, land northern cities. Knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not walleye in the valley of despair. I say to you today, my friend. So, even though we face the difficulties, Of today and tomorrow. I still have a dream. Yes. It is a dream. Deeply rooted in the american dream. I have a dream. That one day. Yeah. This nation will rise up. Live out the true meaning of its tree. We hold these tools to be self-evident. That all men are created.

I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of our skin, but by the content of that character. I have a dream today.

This is our hope. This is a faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.

Every hill and mounting. So be made low, the rough places would be made plain and the crooked faces will be made straight and the birds of be revealed in the last flesh shall see it together. This is our hope, this is the faith that i go back to the south with. With this faith. We will be able to you out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope with this faith. We will be able to transform the dangling, discourse of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood with this faith. We will be able to work together to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together to stand up for freedom together. Knowing that we will be free one day.
